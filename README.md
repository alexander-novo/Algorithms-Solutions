# Introduction to Algorithms Solutions

This repository contains LaTeX files detailing the solutions to every exercise in Introduction to Algorithms, Third Edition by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein.

This is currently being done as a hobby project by a senior at UNR (who is currently taking the class algorithms).
