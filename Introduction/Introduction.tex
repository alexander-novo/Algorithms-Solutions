	This is a list of solutions to the third edition of \textit{Introduction to Algorithms} by Thomas H Cormen, Charles E Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein. The solutions are all my own, done in my free time as a hobby. As such, the solution presented for problem may be only \textit{one} of the solutions to that problem.

	\section*{Notation}
	\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Notation}

	The notation used in this document vary based on my own personal preferences to the notation used in the book. This is espcially true for mathmetic notation not introduced by the book. As such, a list of different notation is available below.
